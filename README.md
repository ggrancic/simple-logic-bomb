# simple-logic-bomb
This is a simple logic bomb written in Python using Tkinter GUI library writen for a Cybersecurity class.

## How it works?
This program is a random password generator in the surface. You can see that behavior in the "safe.py" code. The "gen.py" will run a script when the "generate" button is pushed, a fork bomb is going to be written in a .bat file. That fork bomb causes denial of service of the operating system (in this case is windows). If the system is rebooted then the script will run again (the program places the script in the autorun folder).
